# Declan Keller — Coding Portfolio

Hi — I'm Declan Keller (GitHub: `kebodmk`). This repository contains my coding projects from college coursework and personal experiments, organized with README files, screenshots, and demo instructions.

## Highlights
- **Enchanted Labyrinth** — Text-based adventure game (Java) using OOP.
- **Maze Solver** — Recursive/backtracking maze solver (CS122).
- **Sunflower Turtle Graphics** — Python turtle drawings demonstrating functions & loops.
- More coursework projects from CS121, CS122, and cybersecurity research.
